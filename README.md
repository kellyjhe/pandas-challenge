Module 4 Challenge

Code Help</p>
I used Xpert for help with code on calculating average test scores per school, in Cell 14.
per_school_math = school_df.groupby("school_name")["math_score"].mean()
per_school_reading = school_df.groupby("school_name")["reading_score"].mean()

Code was also used from the sample solution, PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb. These include Cells 7, 9, 10, 11, 17, 18, 19, 22, 23, 24, 25,c26, 27, 29, 31, 33.
